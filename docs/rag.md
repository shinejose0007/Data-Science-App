# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines a retrieval step (searching a document store) with a generation step (an LLM or answer assembler).
Even without a large LLM, building a retrieval index and assembling retrieved passages is a powerful approach
for providing grounded answers to user queries.
